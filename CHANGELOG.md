# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and both this changelog and the crate's versioning scheme follow what the
[Bend repository](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend) is using at the moment.

## [Unreleased]

All current features are yet unreleased on a stable version, and are only available in the `0.2.37` alpha versions. Only the latest alpha version will be shown in this changelog, with all the pre-release features included in it.

## [0.2.37-alpha.3] - 2024-08-30

### Added

- Multiline comments
- All implemented syntax features of Bend as of the release date.

### Fixed

- Comments sometimes would register as errors
